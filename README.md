# [temperature-converter](https://weiffert.github.io/temperature-converter/)

This is my second in a series of converters. Styling was bootstrapped from the [hex-to-rgb-converter](https://github.com/weiffert/hex-rgb-converter). The project stemmed from not knowing celsius, and as the temperature rises, the background color becomes more red and cooler becomes more blue.
